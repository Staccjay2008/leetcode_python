16. 3Sum Closest
Medium
company Amazon, Adobe, Bloomberg
Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
 

Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 500
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
-104 <= target <= 104

# Approach
 2 pointer

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n^2)

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return -1
        
        nums.sort()
        min_result = sys.maxsize
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            left = i + 1
            right = len(nums) - 1

            while left < right:
                if abs(nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right] - target) < abs(min_result - target):
                    min_result = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
                if nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right] > target:
                    right -= 1
                else:
                    left += 1
        return min_result
